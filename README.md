> In this project, we will test code according to the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD). The program being tested is the "producer-consumer" model. In this program, a producer generates "Item" objects, and the consumer consumes "Item" objects. "Item" objects are stored in a "Buffer" object, from which the consumer can retrieve "Item" objects. Producer and consumer objects are not implemented, and only their interfaces are accessible. Both classes should be simulated and should implement the correct interface. All code should be tested. The test should include (if applicable) boundary testing, null values, exceptions, input/output, data types, etc.
