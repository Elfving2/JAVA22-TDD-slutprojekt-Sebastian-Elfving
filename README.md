# TDD final assignment

## Assignment

> In this project, we will test code according to the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD). The program being tested is the "producer-consumer" model. In this program, a producer generates "Item" objects, and the consumer consumes "Item" objects. "Item" objects are stored in a "Buffer" object, from which the consumer can retrieve "Item" objects. Producer and consumer objects are not implemented, and only their interfaces are accessible. Both classes should be simulated and should implement the correct interface. All code should be tested. The test should include (if applicable) boundary testing, null values, exceptions, input/output, data types, etc.

Start was rocky, i felt alot of confusion on what we where actually going to create, after having a discussion with the teacher it got more clear. Reading some of mockitos 
[Wiki](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/wiki/FAQ) and [Blog post](https://mydailyjava.blogspot.com/) gave me some insight on what mocking was and tips & tricks. Project was fun and gave me more insight on how important it is to test you classes and how it helps others to understand what your code actually does.
